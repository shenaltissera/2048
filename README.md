# 2048 Game

This is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to be played in a web browser and is a fun and challenging puzzle game where the goal is to combine tiles to reach the 2048 tile.

## How to Play

1. **Accessing the Game**: You can play the game by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser. No additional installation or setup is required.

2. **Game Rules**: The game is played on a 4x4 grid. You can use your arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number collide while moving, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values. The goal is to create a tile with the value of 2048.

3. **Scoring**: Your score is displayed in the top-left corner. Each time two tiles merge, your score increases by the value of the merged tiles.

4. **Winning**: The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 is created. You can continue playing after winning to achieve a higher score.

5. **Losing**: The game is lost when the grid is full, and no more moves can be made.

6. **Restart**: You can restart the game at any time by clicking the "New Game" button.
